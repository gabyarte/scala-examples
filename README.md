# Scala examples

This repository contains my application and algorithm examples to learn and practice the Scala programming language. It is mainly based in the [Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html).

## Directories
You can find the following directories:
* `hello-world/`: Application template to print the first **Hello World!** using Scala.
* `random-code/`: Project to test essential Scala concepts.
